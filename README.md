Raspberry Pi Omnichord

	The goal is to use a Raspberry Pi to run a real time  digital musical instrument inspired by the Suzuki Omnichord.
	Working on figuring out how to do that, but I currently intend to use pygame midi and some gpio pins.
	Can't be that hard right?

	Updates to follow unless I get bored.
test?
